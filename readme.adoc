== why should I use it:
lamark is
zero-weight,
distractions-free,
app- and renderer-free,
device-free (can be used on paper),
machines-friendly and humans-first.

inspired by YAML.


== has two versions:
* light version for a quick start,
* full version for more advanced features,
  such as the task manager.


== usage options:
* as plain text:
  use it in any text/code editor.

* on paper:
  use it on real paper with a pencil.


== quickstart:
just start to structuring your text
lean on lamark syntax. Wherever you want.
