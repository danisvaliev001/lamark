== why else should I use it:
lamark is
zero-weight,
distractions-free,
app-free and renderer-free,
device-free (can be used on paper),
machines-friendly and humans-first.

inspired by YAML.

== usage options:
* as plain text:
  use it in any code/text editor app.

* as _AsciiDoc_ extension:
  use it directly in _AsciiDoc_ with https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/hard-line-breaks/#per-document[preserve line breaks],
  it is really very handy.

* as code in Markdown:
  use it in all apps that support _Markdown_,
  using https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks[code formatting feature],
  in messengers, for example, it is handy.

* on paper
  use it on paper with pencil.


== quickstart:
just start to structure your text
lean on lamark syntax. Wherever you want.
